(just the runtime for a self-made private prototyping system)

> Do not worry about this repository - it just contains the runtime part of a simple self-made prototyping system which is not planned to be published (because it is nothing but a horrible and really dynamic hack)
>
> It solely exists to make the runtime publicly available for the demos which are included in other repositories.
